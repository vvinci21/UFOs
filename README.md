# UFOs Analysis

Use JavaScript to create a dynamic webpage for UFO sighting data.

The information is displayed on a webpage that accepts user input for any combination of the search criteria. The UFO data is pulled from the [data.js](https://github.com/RuthLD/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js) file, well [app.js](https://github.com/RuthLD/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js) holds the code for the filters, and the [index.html](https://github.com/RuthLD/UFOs/blob/main/index.html) holds the webpage code.

## Using the Webpage Results: 
The filters to search by are located below the introduction to the webpage.

* Use the "Date" filter, type a date in the mm/dd/yyyy format into the box, and then click outside the box to update the table.

* Use the "City" filter, type a city's name in lowercase into the box, then click outside the box to update the table.

* Use the "State" filter, type the two-letter abbreviation of a state in the United States in lowercase into the box, then click outside the box to update the table.
 
* Use the "Country" filter, type the two-letter abbreviation of a country using lowercase into the box, and then click outside the box to update the table.

* To use the "Type" filter, type a shape name like "triangle" or "circle" into the box using lowercase, then click outside the box to update the table.

* To use multiple filters, follow the instructions for each of the search criteria in any order, one after the other. You will see the table update with each filter added.
If the table is empty, there is no data for the information inputted in the search criteria.
 
## Summary: 
One area that can be improved is that when the search criteria retruned no reults there was no way of knowing the search was performed.

The webpage can be improved by adding the date search to be more broad and possbily a range of dates. Having an error message or notification of an empty search results.
